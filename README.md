# Gimme your content punk!

This is a project to showcase what happens to a page with and without a font loading strategy and how to show content to your users while this is happening.

## Run the project locally

  - Clone the repository.
  - In the root folder of the project run `yarn`.
  - Then `yarn bundle` to create `font.js` for the optimized page.
  - Finally `yarn serve` will start a server at port `5000` with the project.

_It's recommended to open the pages with network and CPU throttling to emulate a mobile slow connection and see it effects on users._
